# Truth_Tables
I had to make a program in python that could run different operations working with truth tables
The executable has more advance options than the code, this is because i lost the last final version of the code.
But as you can see in the code iÂ´m using different concepts that could help me to develop the truth table program.
The most advance skill i used in the proyect were objects.
I think this is a good example of my skills as a developer in python,
